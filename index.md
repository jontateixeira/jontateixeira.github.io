My name is Jonathan C. Teixeira, I’m an assistant professor in <a href="https://ctec.ufal.br/graduacao/engenharia-do-petroleo">the Petroleum  Engineering course in The Technology Center</a> at <a href="https://ufal.br/">Federal University of Alagas</a>.  Before joining UFAL, I was previously is an post-doctoral in the Research Institute in Petroleum and Energy Research (LITPEG) at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) where I worked for +9 years. I received my BS and MS in chemical engineering, and PhD in civil engineering from UFPE. During my career in research I have been involved in many multidisciplinary projects related to geomechanics problems from reservoir to near-wellbore and wellbore scales (HM analysis, fault sealing and (re)activation analysis, fracture modelling, and wellbore stability). My research interests are in predictive and mathematical modelling of multiphysics phenomena around flow, with applications to geomechanics, fracture and reactive fluid mechanics, multiphase flows, and undergroud fluid (carbon and hydrogen) storage. My teaching interests are in all areas of reservoir engineering, O&G production facilities, geomechanics, scientific computing and numerical methods applied to transport phenomena.
